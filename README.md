# Newsletter Signup App

## Overview
This app uses the Mailchimp API to create a newsletter subscription service, allowing me to send emails to people who have opted in to receive them.

On the surface, the signup form is simple, but it has powerful capabilities behind the scenes that enable me to add people to my mailing list.

If the signup process is successful, the user will be redirected to the Success page with a confirmation message. Conversely, if the signup is unsuccessful, the user will be taken to the Failure page with a button to attempt the signup again.

Whenever someone fills out the form, the data is sent to my Mailchimp list, creating a new subscriber. This list can then be used to send newsletters or other email campaigns. With more and more people subscribing, the list will continue to grow, making it an invaluable tool for businesses and companies. However, I am not currently using it for this purpose.
